## Why “Oxpecker”?
The oxpecker is a bird known for its mutualistic relationship with large animals. it helps by removing ticks and parasites, while benefiting from a steady source of food. Similarly, this tool acts as a helper for developers: it “cleans up” your SQL and transforms it into fully annotated Java classes, saving time and reducing boilerplate code. Just like the oxpecker and its host, SQL and Java work together in harmony.
